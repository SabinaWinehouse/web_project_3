                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on
                the shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right
                mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring
                are are absolutely amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
                you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is
                difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and
                prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts
                of the right one.

                The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the
                summer months.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient
                is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame
                is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town.
                It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever
                to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky.
                The town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside.
                It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and
                visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios,
                and more. The town holds a yearly festival celebrating
                "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                wooden spoon.

                However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the
                south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
                coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every
                student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you

                sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the

                altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source

                the country.

                Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan, with a population of
                about 2 million. It was the capital of Kazakhstan from 1929 to
                1997, when the government relocated the capital to Akmola
                (renamed Astana in 1998, and Nur-Sultan in 2019). Almaty is
                still the major commercial and cultural centre of Kazakhstan, as
                well as its most populous and most cosmopolitan city.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The city is located in the mountainous area of southern
                Kazakhstan near the border with Kyrgyzstan in the foothills of
                the Trans-Ili Alatau at an elevation of 700–900 m (2,300–3,000
                feet), where the Large and Small Almatinka rivers run into the
                plain. The city was the host for a 1978 international conference
                on Primary Health Care where the Alma Ata Declaration was
                adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health.
